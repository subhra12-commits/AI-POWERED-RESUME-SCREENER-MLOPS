# 🧠 Resume Screener - AI-Based Candidate Filtering

**"Let AI read resumes, match job requirements, and shortlist the right candidates—instantly."**

A complete **End-to-End Machine Learning pipeline** that parses resumes, matches them with job descriptions using NLP, ranks them by relevance, and offers insights via a clean Flask dashboard. Built with **BERT**, **MLflow**, and **Flask**, and containerized with **Docker**—this project simulates a real-world HR assistant powered by AI.

💡 Why BERT for Matching?
Think of BERT as an HR manager who reads between the lines—it understands the meaning behind resume sentences, not just keywords.

Deep semantic understanding

Handles context like "Python (not snake) developer"

Pre-trained on millions of documents

💥 What You'll Learn from This Project
End-to-End NLP pipeline development

Real-world resume parsing and vectorization

Semantic similarity with BERT and cosine distance

Flask UI design for ML apps

MLflow tracking + Docker deployment
